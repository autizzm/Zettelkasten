# What is Source Materials Folder for

It is used for quote from books, videos, etc. [[Main Notes Suggestion |Main Notes]] are created after the Source Materials and contain links to them. 

The Source Materials are in context. (For example  Source Materials note contains quotes from Java Threading page by Baeldung. It is connected to the source of the information).

But the Main Note contains only the most important information and links to the Source Materials on each particular subtopic. 

One Main Note may contain many sub topics and even each sub topic may link to (and cover) many Source Materials.

In Main Note we summarize the date from the Source Materials.
