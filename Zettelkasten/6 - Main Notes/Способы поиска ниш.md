# Способы поиска ниш

### Эмпирический способ:

- What might you (and potentially other consumers) need that currently isn’t available for purchase?  

- What specific problems do you want to solve?

- What could you offer to consumers, based on your strengths?

- What kinds of consumers would share your values, passions, and experiences?

- What basic demographic and psychographic details do you imagine these kinds of consumers share?

### Формальные способы:

- PPC on Online Ads Services

- Google autocomplete: Start typing a few Google inquiries and note the keywords and phrases that Google automatically suggests, based on what’s trending.
	For example, if you want to learn more about green consumers, type “non-toxic” into a Google search, and you may find that Google suggests, “non-toxic cookware” or “non-toxic cleaning supplies.” Typing these keywords into SEO research sites like Semrush and Ahrefs can reveal important metrics such as the search volume for a particular keyword and the difficulty of ranking high in a search result. These can offer clues as to what’s important to your niche market.

- тематические группы в соц сетях (вк, тг, instagram, пинтерест?, Xitter) + хэштеги на этих платформах

- Исследование конкурентов.

- Исследовать быстрорастущие ниши используя, например данные о трудоустройстве населения, демографии. Использовать сторонние прогнозы роста сфер и вакансий.  Искать спрос:
	Let’s consider the latest list of fastest-growing occupations published by the [US Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/fastest-growing.htm). Topping the list is wind turbine service technicians, which illustrates the popularity of the renewable energy sector.
