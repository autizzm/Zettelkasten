# Effective Tagging

1. Avoid vague `[vaegue]` (расплывчатые) tags
2. Ask yourself: *Will I ever use this tag again?*
3. Personalize your tags (For example instead of using tag `fitness` use `posture exercises`)
4. Look at the similar notes so you won't forget tags as the amount of tags increases in the future.
5. Avoid using too many tags (preferably less than 4 or 5)

### In Summary

Narrow the tag's range by personalizing but not too much, so you can unite more than one notes under the tag.
