This question hunted me for the past few weeks. I havent find one contemporary who actually explained it well (and, therefore, for my standards, understand it). Basically, Fisher used it a 100 years ago and Walker (1940) explained it rather clearly (search walker degree of freedom ; there's a guy who retranscribed it. his version is scuff but otherwise you have to pay for her article). Fisher wanted to estimate with precision the population mean and variance from a sample. To do, he imagined an infinite population. In brief, Fisher used N-geometry to do calculations ; he allocated a dimension for sample values possibilities (1 sample = 1 axis) for a total of "N" dimensions. Therefore, every sample had infinite value in their realm. However, if you set a mean, they get stuck to move together around the value of the mean. By doing so, their "degree of liberty" was dependant of 1 value in a sample, which reduce their degree of liberty by 1 (N-1). In the same way a train exist on a straight path, you can know its position with only one coordinate even though it also exist in a 2D system (excluding height and time). See the article of Walker 1940. There's also the article of JL Rodgers 2019 (degree of freedom at the start of the second 100 years) that gives great insights of the manipulation of degree of freedom complementarely to Walker. Otherwise, there's the concept that a sample is always sampler than the population. Therefore, you never ever can be sure of the mean/average of the population estimated from a sample without a) collecting everysingle sample of the population or b) using mathematics to calculate the value toward which the samples tend toward (notion of limits). In those formulas, there's the explanations of the apperance of 1/(n-1). TLDR : The reason why it has a 1/(n-1) in the variance formula has basically been forgotten by the majority of the majority of the people who should know it. https://www.studocu.com/row/document/jamaa%D8%A9-alkahr%D8%A9/faculty-of-graduate-studies-for-statistical-research/degrees-of-freedom/43598306?fbclid=IwAR0ujzGHqcqm6DL-eRKbZs1LbcP_X8XdO5KR_8eOxoY8JEKlp7fqJV4xWdg_aem_AZwtXgCL3q6XBDsNS4z_aOCNDQTeGcaIpA76yrROzeoq9KlY7EpBL_R5ZtOcoPVl8GoR6JrgtEd1xQgvHjvUzOfc
