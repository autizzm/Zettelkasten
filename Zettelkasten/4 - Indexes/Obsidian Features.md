(Like the contents page of a book)

This is just a former tag, that I moved to Indexes. And as It's Index from now, here I list notes containing the former 'Test Index' tag and give them a logical structure.

### Test sub header of the topic:

1. - [[Why use Notes as Tags]]
2. - [[Why use the Main Notes folder]]
3. - [[Test Anki Flashcards]]

### Really useful starting notes:

1. - [[Hotkeys]]
2. - [[Obsidian Markdown example]]
3. - [[Effective Tagging]]
4. - [[Status Tags]]
5. - [[Main Notes Suggestion]]
6. - [[References Suggestions]]
